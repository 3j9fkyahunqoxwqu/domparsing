<h2>Conformance requirements</h2>
<p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", <!--"SHALL", "SHALL
NOT",--> "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC2119. For readability, these words do
not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification. <span
data-anolis-ref>RFC2119</span></p>

<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms
(such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and
abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the
key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the
algorithm.</p>

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to
be performant.)</p>

<p id="hardwareLimitations">User agents may impose
implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs,
e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running
out of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.</p>

<p>When a method or an attribute is said to call another method or attribute, the user agent must invoke its internal API for that attribute or method so that e.g. the author can't change the behavior by overriding attributes or methods with custom properties or functions in ECMAScript.

<p>Unless otherwise stated, string comparisons are done in a <span
data-anolis-spec=domcore>case-sensitive</span> manner.

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as
required for conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL
specification. <span data-anolis-ref>WEBIDL</span>

<p>Some of the terms used in this specification are defined in <cite>DOM
Core</cite>.
<span data-anolis-ref>DOMCORE</span>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>

<p>Vendor-specific proprietary extensions to this specification are
strongly discouraged. Authors must not use such extensions, as
doing so reduces interoperability and fragments the user base,
allowing only users of specific user agents to access the content in
question.</p>

<p>If vendor-specific extensions are needed, the members should be
prefixed by vendor-specific strings to prevent clashes with future
versions of this specification. Extensions must be defined so that
the use of extensions neither contradicts nor causes the
non-conformance of functionality defined in the specification.</p>
<!-- thanks to QA Framework -->

<p>When vendor-neutral extensions to this specification are needed,
either this specification can be updated accordingly, or an
extension specification can be written that overrides the
requirements in this specification. When someone applying this
specification to their activities decides that they will recognise
the requirements of such an extension specification, it becomes an
<dfn title="other applicable specifications">applicable
specification</dfn> for the purposes of conformance requirements in
this specification.</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>
<pre class=idl>interface <dfn>XMLDocument</dfn> : <span data-anolis-spec=domcore>Document</span> {
};

[Constructor]
interface <dfn>DOMParser</dfn> {
  <span data-anolis-spec=domcore>Document</span> <span title=dom-DOMParser-parseFromString>parseFromString</span>(DOMString str, DOMString contentType);
}</pre>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-DOMParser-parseFromString><code>parseFromString(<var
title>str</var>, <var title>contentType</var>)</code></dfn> method must run the
following steps:
<ol>
 <li><p>If <var title>contentType</var> isn't <code title>text/xml</code>, <code
 title>application/xml</code> or <code title>application/xhtml+xml</code>, raise
 a <code title=dom-DOMException-NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR
 data-anolis-spec=domcore>NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR</code> exception and abort these
 steps.

 <li class=XXX><p>Parse <var title>str</var> with a namespace-enabled XML
 parser. If <var title>str</var> was well-formed, return the document.

 <li><p>Otherwise, let <var title>document</var> a newly-created
 <code>XMLDocument</code> node. Append an <code
 data-anolis-spec=domcore>Element</code> node to it, with its <code
 title=dom-Node-localName data-anolis-spec=domcore>localName</code> set to <code
 title>parsererror</code> and its <code title=dom-Node-namespaceURI
 data-anolis-spec=domcore>namespaceURI</code> set to <code
 title>http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/xml/parsererror.xml</code>. User agents
 may append nodes to this element, for example to describe the nature of the
 error.
</ol>
